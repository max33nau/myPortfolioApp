<h3> About </h3>

<p> Hi, my name is Max Jacobsen. Straight out of college, I got a offer to go play professional basketball in Portugal for a year. There
was no way I was going to turn that offer down. It was a enlightening experience to go do the thing I loved in a completely new culture. Now I want
to transfer the same passion I had for basketball into the coding industry. I love the challenging atmosphere it provides and how there is always something
new to learn. </p>
