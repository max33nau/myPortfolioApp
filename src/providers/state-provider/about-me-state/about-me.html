  <h3> About </h3>

  <p> Hi, my name is Max Jacobsen. I just completed Code Fellow’s 18 ­week Full­Stack JavaScript Development boot camp.
  From my boot camp experience, I realized I am most passionate about creating web applications that give users a meaningful and memorable experience.
  I really want to build applications that will benefit others and solve problems that will help improve our technology driven world.</p>

  <p> I graduated at Northern Arizona University (NAU) with a Electrical Engineering degree. I have always enjoyed solving difficult problems and working with numbers.
    During my college experience, I played three years of Division I basketball for NAU. After graduation, I was given the opportunity to go play professional basketball in
    Portugal for a year. It was an enlightening experience where I learned a lot about their culture and how to adapt to playing with teammates who could hardly speak my language. </p>

  <p>  I have always had a great passion for basketball. Now I want to transfer that same passion I had for basketball into the coding industry. I love the challenging atmosphere it provides
    and how there is always something new to learn. </p>
