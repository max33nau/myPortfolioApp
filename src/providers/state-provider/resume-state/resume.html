    <div class='resume-subject-child'> <span class='resume-subject-child-header'>Color Fish </span> - May 2016 </div>

    <p> Participated in a 48-hour hackathon called Angular Attack. My team was comprised of two other developers. We built the web app in Angular 2 and TypeScript. It was the first time we had ever used Angular 2 and it was a really cool experience. The result of our hardwork was Color Fish, a color tool for web designers where you can upload a photo and quickly get a palette of 5 of the most common colors in the photo in hex and RGBA values, customized color-name CSS classes, SCSS variables and a template of the color samples.  </p>

    <div class='resume-subject-child'> <span class='resume-subject-child-header'>Relax And Color </span> - March 2016 </div>
    <p> Web App designed for people who can’t find the time to work on coloring books
      but still want the feeling of relaxation and creativeness associated with them.
      The app brings coloring books to your screen so you can color anytime and anywhere.
      The app was built using the JavaScript MEAN Stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node). </p>

    <div class='resume-subject-child'> <span class='resume-subject-child-header'> Settlers of Candyland </span> - December 2015 </div>
    <p> Inspired by the Settlers of Catan board game, this web app allows the user to play the game anywhere with a tablet or a computer. Written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
      I wrote the functionality for the game using jQuery and Handlebar templates. </p>
